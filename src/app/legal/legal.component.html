        <strong>Your privacy is important to us!</strong><br>
        But don’t worry, we’re not here to sell your secrets to the highest bidder. We promise to keep your data safer than a secret recipe for grandma's cookies. Here’s how we handle it:

    <h3 class="legal-subheading">Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p class="legal-text">
        <strong>We collect data only for the good stuff (like improving your experience).</strong><br>
        Your personal information will not be shared with shady third parties or sold to aliens—cross our hearts.

        <li>Your personal information will not be shared with shady third parties or sold to aliens—cross our hearts.</li>
        <li>We respect your privacy like a ninja respects the shadows. Quiet and undetected.</li>

        So go ahead, browse in peace. Your data is safe with us. No funny business, we swear!

    <h3 class="legal-subheading">Terms of Service</h3>
    <p class="legal-text">
        <strong>By using BidNow, you agree to these Terms of Service!</strong><br>
        Yes, we know, reading terms can be a snooze fest. But hey, if you’re reading this, you're already a champion of responsibility! Here's the TL;DR:
    </p>
    <ul class="legal-list">
        <li><strong>Use the site responsibly</strong> – No hacking, no bad behavior, and definitely no trying to break the internet.</li>
        <li><strong>No spamming</strong> – Seriously, nobody likes a spammer. You’re here for awesome auctions, not to clutter up the place.</li>
        <li><strong>Respect the community</strong> – Be nice. Treat others like you’d want to be treated—unless you’re a supervillain, in which case, we don’t recommend it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="legal-text">
        By continuing, you agree to follow these, because that’s what cool people do. Thank you for being awesome!
    </p>

    <h3 class="legal-subheading">Cookie Policy</h3>
    <p class="legal-text">
        <strong>Yes, we use cookies.</strong><br>
        No, not the chocolate chip kind (sorry). We’re talking about the digital kind that make your browsing experience smoother than a freshly waxed surfboard.
    </p>
    <ul class="legal-list">
        <li>They help us remember your preferences, like if you’re Team "Dark Mode" or Team "Bright Mode" (no judgment, both are cool).</li>
        <li>They help us make your time on BidNow more delightful than a puppy in a basket.</li>
        <li>They are not there to track you like some creepy spy. They just want to make your time here better, like a well-timed joke.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="legal-text">
        So, if you’re cool with cookies (the digital ones, not the snackable ones), just keep browsing. If you’re not, you can always disable them, but we can’t guarantee the site will be as fun without them!
