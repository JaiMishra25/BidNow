        <strong>Lost in the world of auctions?</strong><br>
        Don't fret! Instead of waiting for us to get back to you, why not try asking 
        <a href="https://chat.openai.com/" target="_blank" class="support-chat-link">ChatGPT</a>? 
        It's like having a super helpful auction assistant at your fingertips. It might not know everything, 
        but it'll sure try! Just ask away, and you might find your answer faster than you'd expect.

        <strong>Need help? Please don't contact us…</strong><br>
        We're pretty good at auctions, but we're not great at answering emails 24/7. 
        So, instead of contacting us, why not check out our Help Center for quick fixes? 
        Our response time is, well... unpredictable, and it's best to let the FAQ and 
        Help Center do their magic!

        <strong>Got questions? Sorry, I can't answer them.</strong><br>
        Our FAQ page is where the magic happens. If you need an answer, 
        that's your go-to place. If it's not there, well, you're on your 
        own—just kidding! (But really, we might not be able to answer all your questions.)
